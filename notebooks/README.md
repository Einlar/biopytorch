# Notebooks

- `Example_CIFAR10.ipynb` is a brief example of usage of the new layers (`BioConv2d` and `BioLinear`).
- `Testing.ipynb` is used to read the weights saved in `SavedModels` and gather statistics, which are then collected in the *Benchmark* table.
- `data.py` and `plotting.py` are just helper modules.
